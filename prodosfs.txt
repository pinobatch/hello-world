Summary of the Apple III SOS File System, also used by
Apple II ProDOS and GS/OS, condensed from
<http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/ProDOS_file_system>

clusters 0-1: boot loader
clusters 2-5: root directory
cluster 6: volume bitmap (1 for each ? cluster)

A directory is a doubly linked list of clusters.
bytes 0-1: ID of previous cluster (0 for first)
bytes 2-3: ID of next cluster (0 for last)

First entry of root directory
0: storage type ($F0) plus name length
1-15: volume label (/[A-Z][0-9A-Z.]+/)
16-23 bytes: reserved
24-27: file system birthtime (per B422)
28: version (usually 0)
29: min_version (usually 0)
30: access (per B423)
31: entry_length (always 39)
32: entries_per_block (floor(508 / entry_length) = 13)
33: file count (number of entries in dir with nonzero storage type)
35: first cluster of volume bitmap (usually 6)
37: size of volume in 512-byte clusters

[TODO: Do subdirectory file counts include the volume label or
the first entry of a subdirectory?]

Volume bitmap has one cluster for each 4096 clusters in a volume.
Each byte represents whether 8 clusters free (1) or used (0).
[TODO: What is the bit ordering?]

First entry of subdirectory
0: storage type ($E0) plus name length
1-15: copy of subdirectory name (/[A-Z][0-9A-Z.]+/)
16-23 bytes: reserved
24-27: directory birthtime (per B422)
28: version (usually 0)
29: min_version (usually 0)
30: access (per B423)
31: entry_length (always 39 in ProDOS)
32: entries_per_block (floor(508 / entry_length) = 13 in ProDOS)
33: file count (number of entries in dir with nonzero storage type)
35: cluster of entry in parent directory
37: index of entry in parent directory (0-12)
38: entry_length of parent directory (always 39)

File
0: storage type ($10, $20, $30, $D0) plus name length
1-15: copy of subdirectory name (/[A-Z][0-9A-Z.]+/)
16: file type
17: cluster of key block
19: number of blocks
21-23: length of file in bytes
24-27: birthtime (per B422)
28: version (usually 0)
29: min_version (usually 0)
30: access (per B423)
31: subtype
33: modification time
37: pointer to first block of parent directory

storage type $10 is small files (1 to 512 bytes)
storage type $20 is medium files (513 to 131072 bytes)
storage type $30 is large files (131073+ bytes)
storage type $D0 is linked list files (i.e. subdirectories)

number of blocks is
- 1 for small files files
- 1+n for medium files, fewer if sparse
- 1+ceil(n/256)+n for large files, fewer if sparse
- at least max(1, ceil(n/4))

Medium files have a cluster list pointing at data clusters
Large files have 2 layers of cluster lists
A zero entry in a cluster list corresponds to a $00-filled cluster
The first cluster in a file is never a zero entry

Creation and modification timestamps are two 2-byte integers

File types:
$01: bad cluster list
$04: text file
$06: binary file; subtype is load address
$0F: directory
$19-$1B: AppleWorks document
$FA: Integer BASIC program
$FB: Integer BASIC save state
$FC: Applesoft BASIC program
$FD: Applesoft BASIC save state
$FE: EDASM relocatable object file
$FF: executable ("system") file, eqv. to $06 with subtype $2000

On 5.25" disk drives, each of 35 tracks contains 8 clusters stored
across 16 DOS 3.3 sectors.

         sector: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
        cluster: 0 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 0 7
half of cluster: 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 2

ProDOS-ordered disk images (.po extension) have the halves of
a cluster in logical order.  DOS 3.3-ordered disk images (.do
or .dsk extension) have the halves in 5.25" sector order.
