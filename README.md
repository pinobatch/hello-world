Issue puns

Pitfall
----
_[Pitfall!]_ [ˈpʰɪʔˌfɔːɫ] is a chart-topping platformer for the Atari 2600 Video Computer System published by Activision.
This was back when Activision and Electronic Arts were still indie studios.
(Yes, there was such a time before they became behemoths.)
It received at several sequels, including _Pitfall 2: Lost Caverns_ on the 2600, which was remade as _Super Pitfall_ on the Nintendo Entertainment System, _Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure_ on Super NES and Sega Genesis, and a _Temple Run_ clone for Apple iOS and Android.
_Super Pitfall_ was poorly received, to put it nicely.

"Pitfall" or "[Pitfall seed]" is also the name of an uncommon item in Nintendo's social simulator _[Animal Crossing]_ for GameCube.
Above ground, a pitfall appears as a white sphere with a red exclamation point, much like the [issue icon] in GitHub.
But when buried, it appears as a crack in the ground, the same as a buried fossil or Gyroid.
If a villager steps on the crack, the villager will fall into a trap and have to mash buttons to climb out.
Because _Animal Crossing_ also included several playable NES games that the player could unlock, there was initially a lot of confusion as to what a "pitfall" was.
Many thought it was an NES game like _Super Pitfall_.

The [pitfall item reappeared][Brawl pitfall] in Nintendo's platform fighting game _Super Smash Bros. Brawl_ for the Wii console, with a similar effect.
Though Nintendo's _Super Smash Bros. For_, the sequel to _Brawl_ on Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, includes several third-party characters as DLC, it still does not include the Pitfall Harry character from _Pitfall!_ as of January 2016.

Here, a "pitfall" may refer to a bug in the documentation.

Unova
----
[Unova] [ˈju:nəvə/] is the region in which Nintendo's cockfighting role-playing games _Pokémon Black Version_ and _Pokémon White Version_ for Nintendo DS (_B&W_ for short) take place.
Its geography roughly corresponds to the area around New York, New York.
In the Japanese versions of _B&W_, Unova is called Isshu (イッシュ), pronounced roughly like "issue".

In this repository, the term "unova" may mean something like a feature request.
We'll see later what it means.
